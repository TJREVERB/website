                <p>
                    The Communications subsystem is primarily responsible for evaluating and handling the communications systems on the
                    Cubesat. The 2U CubeSat (TJREVERB) is predicated on testing the communications systems onboard. On this CubeSat,
                    we will be testing two types of radios: one simplex UHF radio and one duplex UHF/VHF radio. The subsystem is
                    responsible for pre-testing the radios as well.

                <p>
                    The Attitude Determination and Control Systems team develops simulations that will predict TJ REVERB’s orbit and attitude. 
                    Through the construction of a Helmholtz Coil, creation of control algorithms in MATLAB, and research into magnetorquer bars, 
                    the ADCS team makes sure that the satellite is successfully controlled while it is in orbit.

                    The Software subsystem exists to assist all other subgroups with any software related tasks. Our responsibilities
                    include: maintaining the TJREVERB website to create awareness for TJREVERB, programming the flight computer of
                    TJREVERB, performing TJREVERB outreach (programming focused or otherwise), and any other miscellaneous
                    software-related tasks assigned to us by other groups.

                <p>
                    The electronics subsystem of the TJ REVERB cubesat team helps test and manage the power supply, solar panels,
                    attitude control, and overall power distribution of the Cubesat. Many of the electrical components will be
                    donated to TJ from commercial partners. As such, a majority of the focus on the team will be connecting
                    components and making sure that the system works correctly in an integrated manner. This will be accomplished
                    through the development of a Helmholtz coil for testing attitude control, the construction of a clean room, and
                    other electrical tests.

                    The CAD/Structural subsystem will be focused more on creation of the 3U chassis (google “3U chassis cubesat” for
                    more insight). For the 2U, we will be using AutoDesk Fusion and OnShape create a computer aided design. As we
                    have recieved most of our parts, we have created computer models to simulate the components and how they will
                    fit together.

                <p>
                    The Outreach team is designed to bring the TJREVERB project to those outside of the team. It is part of NASA’s
                    mission and our own. We will be performing documentation for the team, so that we have records of the decisions
                    made and the reasoning behind them. The team’s primary goal is to organize a workshop for teams from local
                    schools where they will build mock CubeSats and learn about our project.

                <p>
                    The purpose of the Thermal Control and Testing team is to ensure that the CubeSat survives in the environment of
                    space. This includes ensuring that CubeSat internal components do not freeze or overheat due to the extreme cold
                    and high heat fluxes in a Low Earth Orbit environment. Generally, the Thermal Control and Testing team requires
                    information pertaining to the various electronic parts within the CubeSat, including their temperature
                    tolerances and their respective efficiencies (to estimate heat output). Material specifics (thickness, type,
                    etc.) are also necessary, for both vibration and thermal testing. To that end, the team will occasionally make
                    contact with the other teams to determine these characteristics. While team members need not know how to conduct
                    every type of testing, they should have some basic knowledge of mechanics and thermal physics. Knowledge of
                    Autodesk Fusion 360 and MATLAB is also appreciated.

                <p>
                At TJ REVERB, we are working on various methods of pushing the frontiers of technology by discovering 
                meaningful results from the data collected by the TJ REVERB Cubsat. 
                To that end, we are currently working on developing a deep learning data analytic algorithm 
                that retrieves data from the cubesat in realtime and works on analysis for future prediction. 
                We also hope to expand this research section to include other models, ranging from Support Vector Machines to Generative Adversarial Networks.
